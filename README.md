# World-Electricity-Analysis
The Capstone Project is about World Electricity Analyzes Using Python, Pandas, SQL, Microsoft-Excel and gives major insides.
## Overview :
-This Project Analyzes and gives major insides about access of electricity ,production of ekectricity throught different sourses(Nuclear,oil,renewable) and also        Disrtibution of losess across countries.
-The Project involves Row data from world Bank ,data wrangling and Data cleaning by using python and Transforming data to the database, retrieving required data using  SQL and visualising insights on Excel according to the problem statement.

# Datasets:
-The Dataset from world bank APIs in JASON and CSV format.The following metadata of datasets.

# Tech Stack Used:
- Python, Pandas(Data Wrangling).
- Microsoft SQL Server (store, Retrive data).
- Microsoft Excel (for Visualization and insides).

# Snapshot of Visualization:
- Shanpshot of Dashboard.

# Important Insights:
- Production Of electricity Through Oil Majorly Increase in mid-1970s and slight decrease due to power transmission and distribusion losses of electricity increases.
- 193 countries in 2020 with more than 75% access to rural electricity which is more than doubled from 92 countries in 1990.
- The Production Of nuclear power has been increasing from 1970s to 2014s.
- Country verses world Electricity gives the access of electricity of india compire to world electricity is less.
- As per Visualization is clear that High income group from the country contribute more than 70% of production of nuclear energy.
- North American, European & Central Asian regions have been majorly contributing in electricity production from nuclear energy.
